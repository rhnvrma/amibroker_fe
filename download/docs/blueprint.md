# **App Name**: Watchtower

## Core Features:

- Watchlist Creation/Deletion: Allow users to create, rename, and delete multiple watchlists.
- Watchlist Switching: Implement a sidebar or tab layout for smooth switching between watchlists.
- Item Addition/Removal: Enable users to add and remove items from their watchlists, with support for multiple attributes per item.
- Real-time Search & Filter: Implement instant and performant search across all item attributes, with filtering and sorting options.
- Default Watchlist Management: Allow users to set a default watchlist to be highlighted and used automatically, including a visual toggle to set and indicate the active watchlist.
- Generative Tagging Tool: Use a tool to analyze the 'category' and 'name' fields of watchlist items to suggest descriptive tags using AI. This can suggest a few general-purpose, predefined tags as well as generating new, dynamic tags based on the toolâ€™s understanding of the item. User should be able to ignore the tool's suggestions, choose some of them, edit them, or write their own.
- Watchlist Import/Export: Allow users to export watchlists, including attributes, and allow them to import it back later.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) to convey trust and stability. This reflects the application's purpose of monitoring assets.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to create a clean and modern backdrop that ensures readability and focus on the content. Desaturated to approximately 20%.
- Accent color: Analogous, brighter, and more saturated purple (#8F60D3) used sparingly for interactive elements like buttons, active states, and highlights.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a modern and neutral aesthetic suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use a consistent set of simple, outlined icons to represent actions (add, delete, edit) and item categories.
- Responsive layout using cards or rows to display watchlist items with hover effects; sidebar or tab layout for switching between watchlists.
- Subtle transitions and animations for adding/removing items, switching watchlists, and interactive elements.
